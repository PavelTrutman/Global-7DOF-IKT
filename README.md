Globally Optimal Solution to Inverse Kinematics of 7DOF Serial Manipulator
=====
Solver for inverse kinematics tasks for general serial manipulators with seven revolute joints.
It combines symbolical and numerical approaches to find a global solution to a polynomial objective function.
A toolbox for Matlab.

Usage
-----
Solver for each of the manipulators is stored in separate folders.
DH parameters of the manipulator are saved in the MATLAB file `manipulator.mat`.
For direct solving by the POP solver, please, refer to the script file `gloptipoly.m`.
For the approach with the symbolic reduction step, please, refer to the script file `GB.m`.
These files are self-explanatory.

For a detailed description of this software, please refer to [[1]](#1).

Several MATLAB toolboxes are required to be installed: GloptiPoly [[2]](#2), YALMIP [[3]](#3), and MOSEK [[4]](#4).
For symbolic preprocessing, Maple installation is needed.
